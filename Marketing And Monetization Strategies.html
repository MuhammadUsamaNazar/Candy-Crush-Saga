        <h1>Marketing And Monetization Strategies Of Candy Crush Saga</h1>
        <h2>Free Game</h2>
        <p>Just like other freemium apps, Candy crush can be downloaded and played free of cost. People are never forced to pay a penny to play the game. It has been designed in a way that free users too can finish the game but with certain restrictions like limited lives and moves. There are only in-app purchases for extra lives and moves. This free model worked really well for Kings as the users got time to try and to get addicted. This addiction led to more, recurring, and long-lasting income.</p>
        <h2>Simple</h2>
        <p>The Game is really simple to play. Users just have to switch adjacent candies to form rows or columns of three of the same colour, which gets disappeared from the board. Fulfilling certain tasks will promote them to the next level. This simple game isn’t that easy though. The difficulty level increases as you move ahead and due to the limited lives provided, users generate a want to play more.</p>
        <h2>Pay To Play More</h2>
        <p>Candy Crush is primarily monetized through the in-app purchases. Users get a set amount of lives (5 lives) and move to complete a level, exhausting which they have to buy extra lives/moves through the in-app purchases. They can also opt for in-app purchases to start new episodes. These purchases can be substituted by sending requests to Facebook friends and hence users are not forced to pay at any stage. Since the friends have to accept the request for the user to move ahead, it takes a lot of time. Hence, users prefer in-app purchases to feed their addiction. The in-app purchase cost is kept very less and an average user have paid around $25 dollar. It’s the number of users that did miracles for the company.</p>
        <h2>Facebook</h2>
        <p>It all started with requests on Facebook. One of the best strategies devised by Candy Crush Saga was the requests on Facebook. A user is asked to either pay or to send requests to their Facebook Friends to get extra lives/moves or to move on to a next episode. Facebook, with over 1.5 billion users, is a perfect platform to engage and gain more users for the application. It became the primary source of new users for the game in its initial stages.</p>
        <h2>Target Group</h2>
        <p>Users of candy crush aren’t limited to any specific demographics. Candy Crush is played by users of all age groups, belonging to all ethnicity and religions, and in all the 7 continents. Fun Fact – The game was actually targeted to women aged 25-45.</p>
        <h2>Social</h2>
        <p>Gamers can see and compare their progress with their friends and family members. This social motivation has made many users shed their money to compete and win against them. Reaching on a high level on Candy Crush is something to be proud of, you don’t reach there easily. The social factor became a good strategy to earn more as people like to show off to people they know.</p>
        <h2>Quality</h2>
        <p>One of the most important factors behind the success of the game is its quality. Candy Crush, which looks a bit like bejewelled, used great graphics mixed with soothing music and most importantly – no glitches. The game maintained top quality by not including advertisements and having full control in the hands of the developers.</p>
        <h2>Positioning</h2>
        <p>It takes hardly 2-5 minutes to complete a turn on Candy Crush. This helped the brand to position itself as a time killer and not just a fun mobile video game.</p>
        <h2>Number of Levels</h2>
        <p>There are currently more than 2000 levels in candy crush. The game becomes more difficult as the user levels up. It is certain, in this game of luck, that the user might get stuck in one or more of the levels. More challenging the levels are, more is the probability of user paying to get it cleared. But Kings had to keep the difficulty moderate as many difficult levels might lead to users abandoning the game.</p>
        <h2>Use of Analytics</h2>
        <p>Candy Crush made good use of analytics to find out what makes their users play more and what is stopping them. Level 65 was considered as one of the most difficult levels and stopped users from playing ahead. This level was soon removed to make users stick and go deep in the game.</p>
